# K-Means-Clustering
K-Means clustering algorithms implemented in Python

* You can run the program with the following command:
    * *python3 kmeans.py \[--file image_file\] \[--k k-value\] \[--max_iters max-iterations\]*, where \[\] indicates optional fields
    * The defult *image_file* is 'fruits.jpg', the default *k-value* is 4, and the default *max-iteratons* is 35

* The outputted image after k-mean clustering is stored in a templated image file (.jpg file)
* I advise you use images with dimensions less than 400x400 pixels for good time performance
